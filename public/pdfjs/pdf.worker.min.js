// This is a placeholder for the actual PDF.js worker file
// In a real implementation, you would download the actual pdf.worker.min.js 
// from https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@4.3.136/build/pdf.worker.min.js
// and place it here. For now, we'll use the legacy worker approach.

// PDF.js Worker - Minified version would go here
// This file should contain the actual PDF.js worker code
console.log('PDF.js worker loaded locally');
